I grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, where I developed a passion for studying ocean life. In May, I will graduate from the University of South Carolina with a B.S. in Marine Science. I began conducting research early on as an undergraduate and have since gained multiple research experiences. At the University of South Carolina, I work in the lab of Dr. Jerry Hilbish, understanding recruitment in marine mussel populations in Southwest England. For the Ernest F. Hollings Scholarship, I completed a summer internship with Dr. Christopher Chambers, looking at the coupled effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and dissolved oxygen on the early life stages of Atlantic silverside. For my PhD, I plan to use an ocean acidification system to conduct exposure experiments on early life stages of oysters. In my free time, I enjoy playing intramural sports, ceramics, watching sports, and spending time with friends.
