I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow Ph.D student at the University of Rhode Island studying Biology and Environmental Science with a concentration in Evolution and Marine Biology. I am currently researching how multiple coastal stressors, such as low salinity, low pH, and hypoxia, structure the population connectivity and microevolution of eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica populations. I have a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology and a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry and Aquaculture and Aquarium Science. I am passionate about using molecular tools to answer questions in marine science and conservation and am looking for connections that will help me in my career.
