I am a junior biological sciences major from North Haven, Connecticut. Ever since I took an evolution course, it sparked my interest in genetics. I am passionate to learn more about how environmental factors can play a large impact on the genetics of organisms. Working alongside Amy Zyck, I am learning about the genes involved in response to certain environmental stressors for oysters.
