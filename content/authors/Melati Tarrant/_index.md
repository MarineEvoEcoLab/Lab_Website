I recently graduated from the University of Rhode Island in December 2019 with a Marine Biology degree. I was born in Indonesia, but grew up in Maryland, right outside of Washington D.C. I have a particular interest in marine conservation and for my future career, I hope to connect interdisciplinary fields such as biology, ecology, and anthropology in order to learn more about how we can conserve and preserve marine environments.
