I'm investigating how environmental stress affects larval and juvenile oysters—because saving the world sometimes starts with shellfish. Growing up in Louisiana, my love for coastal areas and seafood systems sparked an interest in food security and sustainable aquaculture. Since graduating from LSU in 2020 (geaux tigers!), I’ve spent countless hours in the molecular lab tinkering with DNA and in wetlabs and hatcheries, happily tending to baby oysters despite the wet boots and long days. I’m excited to put down roots in the Chesapeake Bay region after my defense. Outside the lab, I enjoy cycling, cooking, and spending time with family and friends.
