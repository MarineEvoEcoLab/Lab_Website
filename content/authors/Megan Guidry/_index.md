I am from just up-river of New Orleans, and I love squishy, slimy inverts! I earned a B.S. in Biology from Louisiana State University. Growing up in southeast Louisiana, where the land meets water and coastal communities are on the front lines of climate change, shaped my interests in fisheries species, specifically oysters. Iâ€™m interested in the intersections of environmental change, stress, and oyster genomics. I also have interests in microbial ecology and coastal water quality. Outside of science, I enjoy cycling classes, reading, listening to podcasts, and watching LSU football.
