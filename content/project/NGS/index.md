The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has rapidly transcended population genetics to population genomics.  Current research focuses on adopting next-generation sequencing technology and embracing an ever-adapting genomic toolkit to take advantage of this unprecedented amount of genetic data.  Current research focuses on developing novel exome capture methods for non-model organisms.
