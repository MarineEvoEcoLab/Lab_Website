The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a valuable fishery and aquaculture species that provides critical services as an ecosystem engineer. Oysters have a life-history that promotes high genetic diversity and gene flow while also occupying a wide range of habitats in variable coastal environments from the southern Gulf of Mexico to the southern waters of Atlantic Canada. To understand the interplay of genetic diversity, gene flow, and intense environmental selection, we used whole genome re-sequencing data from 90 individuals across the eastern United States and Gulf of Mexico, plus 5 selectively bred lines. Our data confirmed a large phylogeographic break between oyster populations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of the USA. We also demonstrated that domestication has artificially admixed genetic material between the two ocean basins, and selected lines with admixed ancestry continue to maintain heterozygosity at these sites through several generations post admixture, possibly indicating relevance to desirable aquaculture traits. We found that genetic and structural variation are high in both wild and selected populations, but we also demonstrated that, when controlling for domestication admixture across ocean basins, wild populations do have significantly higher levels of nucleotide diversity and copy number variation than selected lines. Within the Atlantic coast, we detected subtle but distinct population structure, introgression of selected lines within wild individuals, an interaction between structural variation and putatively adaptive population structure, and evidence of candidate genes responding to selection from salinity. Our study highlights the potential for applying whole genome sequencing to highly polymorphic species and provides a road map for future work examining the genome variation of eastern oyster populations.
