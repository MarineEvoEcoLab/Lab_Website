The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, now has its first complete chromosome-level genome assembly. Released and annotated in 2017, this genome is over 97% complete and serves as a vital resource for studying how mollusks adapt to changing environments and for improving selective breeding in aquaculture. To enhance the accuracy of genomic studies, we developed a method to correct assembly errors caused by high levels of genetic variation. This method significantly improves the detection of genetic diversity and population structure, offering a valuable tool for researchers and breeders alike. Our open and reproducible resource ensures better genomic analysis for future studies.
