As I sit and reflect on the Spring 2024 semester, I am just amazed at all the incredible achievements of the PLOMEE team!  

We started the Spring semester with [Gabe Barret](/author/gabriel-barrett) defending his Master's thesis, "VARIANT GRAPHS IMPROVE ACCURACY OF DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS
IN RESTRICTION SITE-ASSOCIATED DNA SEQUENCING."

Two undergraduates, [Cierra Westbrook](/author/cierra-westbrook) and [Erin Wildes](/author/erin-wildes), and Research Technician [Caitlin Randall](/author/caitlin-randall) presented their first posters at a national conference, the National Shellfisheries Association.  PhD student, [Megan Guidry](/author/megan-guidry) also rocked a presentation at the same conference!

Research technician, [Caitlin Randall](/author/caitlin-randall), was accepted into the LSU [LAGNiAppE Postbaccalaureate Progam ](https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/programs/postbacc-research/index.php)

PhD student [Cassandra Cerasia](/author/cassandra-cerasia) was awarded the NSF [Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Undergraduate [Cierra Westbrook](/author/cierra-westbrook) was awarded the Elmer A. Palmatier Memorial Scholarship from the Department of Biological Sciences.

Undergradaute [Lauren Albanese](/author/lauren-albanese) graduated *Summa Cum Laude* in May, and she landed a coveted internship at the [Karen Beasley Sea Turtle
Rescue and Rehabilitation Center](https://www.seaturtlehospital.org/).

Undergraduate [Hector Santiago](/author/hector-santiago) graduated *Summa Cum Laude* in May, and he is awaiting official word on an awesome job at a high-profile research institute in New England.

Phd students [Amy Zyck](/author/amy-zyck) and [Jacob Green](/author/jacob-green) pumped out something close to 700 exome library preps.  Keeping me busy submitting sequencing orders and finding hard drive space!

We're also super lucky to have undergrads [Juliana Bucci](/author/juliana-bucci) and [Cierra Westbrook](/author/cierra-westbrook) agree to stay and work in the lab for a second summer!

It's such a long list of achievements, and these are just the biggest ones.  I have to say that I am just so incredibly proud of the PLOMEE team!
