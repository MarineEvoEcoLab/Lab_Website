He has his B.S. in Molecular biology with a Chemistry minor from California State University Monterey Bay. There, Jacob worked with Dr. Cheryl Logan, investigating juvenile and larval rockfish physiological responses to climate change using enzyme assays, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatics.  Jacob was also a Sally Casanova Pre-Doctoral Scholar, and he worked in the Puritz lab last summer conducting the first de novo exome assemblies of the eastern oyster. Jacob is interested in developing de novo techniques and bioinformatic pipelines for phylogenomic analysis and exploring the adaptation of the Eastern Oyster immune system in response to disease and climate change.
