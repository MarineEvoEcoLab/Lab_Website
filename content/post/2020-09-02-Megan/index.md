The Puritz Lab of Marine Evolutionary Ecology welcomes new PhD student Megan Guidry!  Megan earned her B.S. in Biology from Louisiana State University, working in Dr. Morgan Kelly's lab and this year was awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  She's interested in the intersections of environmental change, stress, and oyster genomics, and she also is hoping to integrate her research with microbial ecology and coastal water quality.  Find out more about Megan and her research on her [lab profile](/author/megan-guidry).
