The Puritz Lab of Marine Evolutionary Ecology in the department of Biological Sciences at the University of Rhode Island is recruiting highly motivated applicants for a postdoctoral position starting immediately (Fall 2023).  USDA ARS Program in Shellfish Genetics and Breeding.  We are seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow to work on a collaborative project that aims to identify the genetic underpinnings of adaptation to multiple stressors in eastern oysters and to fully characterize the population genetic structure of the eastern oyster across the northeastern United States for helping the the development of a new northeastern selective breeding program. The position is an initial one-year appointment (with the possibility of renewal for at least two more years) funded by a cooperative agreement with the USDA ARS. The expectation is that products from this research will provide advanced understanding of oyster response to stress and enhance capacity for precision breeding of more resilient oysters for the aquaculture industry.

### Responsibilities:

The successful candidate will be expected to execute independent research using disease and environmental challenge experiments (adults and larvae) in the laboratory, leading population genomic analysis utilizing multiple different technologies (possibilities include a SNP chip, WGS, and exome capture), and manuscript preparation.  There will be additional opportunities for involvement in improving the eastern oyster (pan)genome as well. The candidate will also help coordinate research across the entire project and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the lab.  

### How to Apply:

We are strongly encouraging applicants from under-represented groups in STEM (including first-generation students) to apply.  Interested individuals should contact Jon Puritz directly (jpuritz 'at' uri.edu) before October 31, 2023.  Please include a CV, brief description of your previous and current research along with future goals, and the names and contact information for three references.  

### Required Qualifications:

A PhD (by position start date) with experience in population genomics, marine evolutionary ecology, experimental evolution, or a related field.  

### Desired Qualifications:

Experience working with marine invertebrates, especially relevant experience in laboratory spawning and larviculture.  Preferred start date is between before January 1, 2024.
