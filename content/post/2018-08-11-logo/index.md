You may have noticed the revamp of the lab logo. I commissioned the design from a colleague of mine from my TAMUCC days, Pavel Dimens (@PVDimens).  I wanted to incorporate the elements of my old logo (an adult sea star, a sea star larvae, and DNA).  After a few rounds of edits, we even added the wave which even better incorporates aspects of my research.  I'm very excited to debut and share with all of you. 

 

Not sure if Pavel is looking for more business, but check out his website (https://pdimens.wixsite.com/paveldimens) and contact him directly for inquiries.
