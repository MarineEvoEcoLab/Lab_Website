We've moved website to the [Hugo Blox Builder](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) platform to help support the open source and open science movement.  Our website code and files are now on our [lab GitHub](https://github.com/MarineEvoEcoLab/Lab_Website)!

If you came to the site on Monday or Tuesday of this week and got an error, apologies as we were migrating our domain name DNS.

Just in case you're wondering where the picture for this post came from...
